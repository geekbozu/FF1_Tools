FF1 3DS .DPK Unpackager/Repackager Tool
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------#
_______________
--:: ABOUT ::--

idk what to say here. Geekboy1011 asked me to do this
and I kinda ran away with it. It looked fun to do.

It unpackages the .dpk files that he says is found in FF1 (3DS) ROMs and
repackages them using the (roughly) same compression scheme that was used
to package these files to begin with.

_______________
--:: USAGE ::--

Python 2.7.x is required to run this packager.
Download and install it if you have not already.

DO NOT attempt to use Python 3.x.
Monkeys and exploding grape biscuits will fly
from your monitor and assault you if you try.
_____________
 To unpack:

repacker.py input_file output_folder

   input_file: Name of the package file you want to unpack
output_folder: Path to the folder where the unpacked files go.
               This directory must already exist before you start.
               Make sure this directory is either empty or contains nothing
               that doesn't belong in the package you're extracting.
           -q: Silences the console output so that only the end result
               shows in the command-line window.
_____________
 To repack:

repacker.py input_folder output_file -r [-f] [-n]

input_folder: Path to the folder that contains all the
              package files and folders.
 output_file: Name of the file where all the packed stuff goes
          -r: You gotta add this to get the repacker to work in
              repackage mode. Otherwise silly things happen.
          -f: Add this switch to repackage using a significantly
              faster but less effective compression method.
          -n: Add this switch to skip compression altogether for
              repackaging purposes. -f will be ignored in this case.
          -q: Silences the console output so that only the end result
              shows in the command-line window.

--:: NOTES ::--

* The FILE NAMES of the unpacked files are very important and MUST NOT CHANGE.
* The FOLDER NAMES are also very important and MUST NOT CHANGE.
* The repackager will choke on files that doesn't belong in the package.

* The "fast compression" method pretty much shrinks the LZ search window from
  2047 to 33. Probably should've reduced it to 1 to effectively make it a
  crappy RLE compressor, but meh. Unless I'm bombarded with complaints,
  I won't care.
* The DLL was built in Code::Blocks. It was fun.
* Everything I know about calling DLLs is found in Python's ctypes
  documentation and the example code I found with aPLib.
* I use DLLs in the Python script instead of calling EXEs since doing so
  removes the overhead of loading and passing args into the EXE on each
  invocation. The performance boost is like the diff between night and day.

DOCS
    Has .DPK file structure documentation. Contact me if anything is wrong
    about it since that's what this whole project is based on.
LICENSE
    The MIT License. Geekboy1011 told me it'll help protect my
    IP rights while still being able to share freely.
README
    The thing you're reading right now.
repacker.py
    The thing you downloaded this whole package for.
tools/_test.py
    Contains demonstration code for using Wp16e.dll
tools/libWP16e.a
    idk what's in here. Code::Blocks spat it out when it compiled my DLL.
tools/libWp16e.def
    Looks like labels for exported functions. Code::Blocks spat it out too.
tools/WP16.py
    Contains a pure Python implementation of the Wp16 algorithm.
    The decompressor is fairly quick.
    Sending the file over dialup is faster than compressing it by itself.
tools/wp16e.c
    (Most of) the source for the DLL. It's up to you to figure out how to
    compile it. The core of it is still there...
tools/Wp16e.dll
    The compiled functions for everything this project needs and uses.
tools/wp16e_docs.TXT
    A function call cheatsheet if you don't want to open the source.

--:: VERSION HISTORY ::--

0.90 - It seems to work. It can recursively unpack and repack and supports
       fast, if less efficient, compression for testing purposes.
       But the real test is to see if what it repacks actually runs on
       hardware. And I don't own the test rig.
0.91 - The game loads but nothing works right. This version adds a
       NO_COMPRESS (-n) option to see if my (de)compression is faulty.
0.92 - No real progress, but added a "quiet" mode to speed up the process
       in cases where the actual console I/O bottlenecks the script.
0.93 - Fixed file padding problem. If the game cares about file sizes being
       padded too, there will definitely be a v0.94 to fix that.
0.94 - Fixed outputting the wrong size at the start of a compressed WP16 
       archive causing the decompressor to not output full files
